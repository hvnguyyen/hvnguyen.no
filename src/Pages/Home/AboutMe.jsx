              Hi! I'm Hoang Vinh Nguyen, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology
              at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my studies, I enjoy backpacking, running, and exploring mountains and nature.
              When I'm relaxing, I love spending time playing boardgames with friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion lies in technology and problem-solving. I'm always looking for opportunities
              to apply my skills in programming and web development.
            </p>
